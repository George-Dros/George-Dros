# Hi, I'm George!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I'm an Applied Mathematics graduate with a focus on Python-based data analysis, modeling, and interactive tools. I enjoy building clear, purposeful applicationsâ€”especially those that make complex ideas easier to explore.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Deep Hedging Neural Network for Derivatives Pricing  
- **Repository**: [Deep Hedging for Options](https://github.com/George-Dros/Deep-Hedging-Neural-Network-for-Derivatives-Pricing)

A PyTorch project that trains a GRU-based neural network to dynamically hedge European call options under realistic market conditions (volatility spikes, jumps, regime shifts).  
Includes CVaR-based loss function, full simulation environment, and backtesting with benchmark metrics and plots.

### 2. Volatility Surface Visualization
- **Repository**: [Volatility Surface Visualization](https://github.com/George-Dros/Volatility_Surface)
- **Streamlit App**: [Live Demo](https://implied-volatility-surface-app.streamlit.app/)

Interactive tool for visualizing implied volatility surfaces across strike prices and time-to-maturity for any given ticker. Useful for traders and analysts interpreting market expectations and option behaviors.

---

### 3. Black Scholes Interactive Heatmap
- **Repository**: [Black Scholes Interactive Heatmap](https://github.com/George-Dros/Black-Scholes-Interactive-heatmap)
- **Streamlit App**: [Live Demo](https://black-scholes-interactive-heatmap.streamlit.app/)

This app generates option price heatmaps using the Black-Scholes model. Customize inputs like volatility and risk-free rate to explore pricing behavior and market mispricing signals.

### 4. Airbnb Data Analysis Dashboard  
- **Repository**: [Airbnb Listings Analysis Dashboard](https://github.com/George-Dros/airbnb-data-analysis) 
- **Streamlit App**: [Live Demo](https://airbnb-data-analysis-4bt46peyrzkpvljg6fkqtz.streamlit.app/)

An interactive dashboard for exploring Airbnb listings in any city. Includes filters for room type, price, availability, and superhost status. Provides automatic visual insights through boxplots, scatter plots, histograms, and a summary panel.
